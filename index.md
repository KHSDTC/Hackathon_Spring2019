# King's College London Health Science DTC

# Python Hackathon Spring session 2019

Everyone is invited to the second King's College London HSDTC Python Hackathon session. The event is intended for everyone with interest in computational and quantitative methods and how they can be applied in solving biological problems.

Our idea is to bring researchers from various backgrounds for an evening of biological problem solving using Python.

We aim to provide a relaxed environment for people to engage, discuss and exchange programming knowledge.

## For whom is this Hackathon intended?

The hackathon is suitable for anyone who regularly uses or wishes to regularly use Python for their research, regardless of their level of expertise with programming.

## Hackathon format

We will divide ourselves in groups of 3-5 people and attempt in solving a set of problems.

## Coding challanges

The Hackathon organisers will provide a set of computational biology problems for you to take on.

## What do you need to bring

- Laptops, power supplies and an inquisitive spirit.
- Working Python environment (2.x, or 3.x). Such environment could be provided by downloading [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
- A good code editor, such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) or [spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/).

## When and Where?

- __Date__: 14th of January, 2019.
- __Where__: Waterloo Campus, James Clerk Maxwell Building B.16.
- __When__: 5-9 PM

The Hackathon session will start at 6PM, but everyone is wellcome to join earlier from 5PM to have a chat with fellow coders! During the evening we will have refreshements provided by HSDTC.

## Registration

In order to understand the number of people that want to attend the session, we would like to ask you to complete the registration at [SkillsForge booking page](https://training.kcl.ac.uk/kcl/#he/dev/eventDetails,;em,providerCode=HSDTC,providerOrgAlias=kcl,number=61). Although, registration is not mandatory and you are wellcome to join us without it, but it would help us out with organisational matters.
